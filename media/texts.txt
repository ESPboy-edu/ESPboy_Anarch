Anarch: a Very Special Game

Anarch: super small public domain no-dependency from-scratch suckless Doom clone

I've made this super small public domain no-dependency from-scratch suckless
Doom clone.

Anarch: extremely small, completely public domain, no-dependency, no-file,
portable suckless anarcho-pacifist from-scratch 90s-style Doom clone that runs
everywhere, made for the benefit of all living beings.

Anarch is a completely public domain, free software 90s-style anarcho-pacifist
Doom clone game which can fit into <MINSIZE> (including all assets), has
extremely low hardware demands, running on platforms with <MINRAM> of RAM on
<MINFREQ> CPU (which doesn't even has to have a floating point unit), has no
dependencies (not even standard C library), requires no filesystem (all assets
are embedded in source code), is extremely portable, made in pure C99 subset
of C++ completely from scratch (including the engine, all assets, the font,
palette etc.) with only free software and released completely into the public
domain (CC0), allowing absolutely any use. It was not made for profit or just
entertainment, it is an engineering art and a philosofical manifesto. For more
info see the website at <WEBSITE> or the repository at <REPOURL>.

The game has been ported to:

- GNU/Linux, SDL
- GNU/Linux, CSFML
- GNU/Linux, terminal
- web browser, emscripten
- Pokitto (220x116, 48 MHz ARM, 36 KB RAM, 256 KB flash)
- Gamebino Meta (80x64, 48 MHz, 32 KB RAM, 256 KB flash)
- Win$hit 7, SDL

As a game, Anarch offers:

- oldschool "pseudo 3D" raycasting rendering in 256 colors
- 10 levels, both interior and exterior, 16 wall textures
- varying floor and ceiling heights, ability to jump
- 6 weapons using 3 types of ammo
- 7 types of enemies
- optional primitive save/load system
- bosses
- optional mouse support
- a few hidden secrets/easter eggs

======== short manual ========

Anarch is a unique suckless FPS game. Collect weapons and items and destroy
robot enemies in your way in order to get to the level finish. Some door are
locked and require access cards. Good luck!

========== pokitto ===========

I am releasing the version 1.0 of my game Anarch.

<gif>

It's a Doom-like first person shooter with 10 levels. It is completely public
domain (CC0), so you can do whatever you wish with it: mod it, hack it, break
it, share it, even sell it. You can just grab it and start playing. The
project has also become a manifesto of some of my philosophies, going beyond
simple entertainment purpose, so if you wish to check it out further, visit

<WEBSITE>

and

<REPOURL>

Reminder: 1.0 doesn't mean bug-free or even finished, it is simply a release
milestone that has all goal features and is pretty much usable.

The game is not exclusive to Pokitto, I've made it to be independent of any
platform so you can also play it on your computer, in a browser
(<PLAYINBROWSER>), or on other consoles. However, it all started here, with the
Pokitto community, when a few years back Pokitto showed me the joy of
programming simple HW, when I began to play around with raycasting, which later
resutlted in raycastlib and eventually this game, and when people started
telling me to make a complete game. Fot this I thank you, the Pokitto community.

downloads:
  <overclocked>
  <normal>
  <joyhat>
  <source>

controls:

- arrows: movement
- A: shoot, confirm
- B: hold for strafing, cancel
- C + A/left, C + B/right: switch weapons
- C + up: jump
- C + down: menu

There is a basic save/load functionality, but it is pretty simple. You are
only able to save game at the beginning of a level, allowing you to load there
with the same health, ammo and stats (time and kills).

It uses bytebeat for music, for simplicity and to save space. This can get
annoying after a while, but of course you can turn off music in the menu :)

<trailer>

Enjoy!

P.S: Yes, there are cheatcodes, or rather only one, but you have to figure it
out yourself :) Besides that there are secret areas on each map.

========== gb meta ===========

This is a GB Meta port of my suckless, platform-independent Doom-like game
Anarch, made with the help of a raycasting library (raycastlib) I've made and
also showcased here on GB Meta some time ago.

The game is completely public domain free software, you can do absolutely
anything with it. It is a small manifesto to some ideas I hold: if you wish to
know more, visit the game's website at <WEBSITE> or the repo at <REPOURL>. You
can also play the game in browser at <PLAYINBROWSER>.  

I am not so knowledgeable about lower level Gamebuino, so I think this port can
be further imporved. If you could access the display directly, maybe you could
get more performance and better rendering. Also I couldn't figure out a way to
play the game's 8bit 8 kHz sounds, so I just play Gamebuino's sounds, maybe this
could be fixed. If anyone skilled with Meta wants to pursue this task, just go
ahead :)

controls:

- arrows: movement 
- A: shoot, confirm
- B: hold for strafing, cancel
- menu + A/left, menu + B/right: switch weapons
- menu + up: jump
- menu + down: go to menu

======== opengameart =========

These are assets from my public domain Doom-like game Anarch (<WEBSITE>).
I have made them all completely myself, from scratch, including taking my own
photos, recording my own sounds etc. I release them all under CC0 1.O, public
domain, for any use whatsoever.

# Releasing my long in development suckless game Anarch!

Hello, I am releasing my game that's a manifesto to the ideas and philosophies
I hold.

It is extremely small, completely public domain (CC0) free software, has
no-dependencies, is extremely portable, suckless, made completely from-scratch
in the 90s-style of the original Doom. I made it for the benefit of all living
beings and am now sharing it with you. Enjoy and spread it around!

======= video trailer =======

This is a trailer for my public domain Doom-like game Anarch. The game is very
special, extremely small, suckless, with tiny hardware demands, running
basically on any platforms. It has many nice properties and is one of its kind.
It is completely free, both as in gratis and freedom. To get it, visit
<WEBSITE>.

====== wikimedia commons =====

This is a screenshot from a public domain game Anarch which I have made. All
assets in the game and the whole software were created completely by me from
scratch and are released under CC0, as is this screenshot.

The game uses software rendering using raycasting and a custom 256 color
palette.

======= libregamewiki ========

Anarch is a completely public domain, free software, suckless 90s-style
anarcho-pacifist Doom-like libre game. It was created by drummyfish, completely
from scratch. The game's aim is to experiment with a different game development
philosophy.

ABOUT

Anarch is made for entertainment but also as a manifesto of certain
philosophies and ideas, including suckless programming, extreme portability,
anti-copyright, selflessness and anarcho-pacifism.

The game is a "pseudo 3D" first person shooter, like Doom, and consists of 10
levels. The graphics uses a 256 color palette and is a little simpler than that
of Doom, having e.g. no textures on floor and ceiling and using just 32x32 pixel
images. The engine uses software rendering and 2D raycasting for rendering.
There are multiple enemy types, weapons and items to pick up. Music is 8bit and
procedurally generated (utilizing so called bytebeat).

FEATURES

Some of the aspects of the game worth mentioning are:

- Extremely small size, being able to fit into 200 KB, including all assets.
- Very low hardware demands, being able to run on 40 MHz embedded CPUs.
- No library dependencies – The game core is written in pure C without any I/O,
  which is left for each platform's frontend to implement.
- Implementation simplicity – no build system is needed, only a single file
  needs to be compiled. The whole source code has <LOCTOTAL> lines of code.
- All assets are part of the source code so no filesystem is required for the
  game to run.
- Extreme portability thanks to the above. Official ports exist for PC,
  terminal, web browser and embedded consoles like Pokitto and Gamebuino Meta.
- Made completely from scratch with only free software, including the engine,
  assets and media.
- Completely public domain status, made completely from scratch by a single
  person and released under CC0 (with an additional waiver of patents).

===== freegamedev forum ======

Hello,

I am releasing version 1.0 of my suckless game Anarch which I've been working
on on evenings for maybe two years.

It's probably a little different from what you expect from a typical modern
game as it is a little experimental and purposfully trying to do things
differently. It looks like from early 90s and will seem shitty and backwards,
but it's just aiming for different goals than wide popularity or making profit.
It's not just a game but also a manifesto of some ideas I hold.

It is extremely small, completely public domain, no-dependency, no-file,
very portable suckless anarcho-pacifist from-scratch 90s-style Doom clone that
runs everywhere (needs just 32 KB RAM and 40 MHz CPU), made for the benefit of
all living beings. For more see the page at libregamewiki: <LIBREGAMEWIKILINK>.

Game-wise Anarch offers:

- oldschool "pseudo 3D" raycasting rendering in 256 colors
- 10 levels, both interior and exterior, 16 wall textures
- varying floor and ceiling heights, ability to jump
- 6 weapons using 3 types of ammo
